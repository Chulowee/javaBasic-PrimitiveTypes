Test -> should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
    1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
        -> The knowledge point of the test is to learn the behavior of booleans and bitwise and how to determine its use. 
        The official document of this knowledge point is https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-tutorial/.
    2. Why the test failed at first?
        -> The test failed at first because the expected result was not assigned. 
        Thus, the expected result and the actual result are not the same.
    3. Why you corrected the test that way?
        ->I corrected it this way since what is used are logical operations, thus I assumed that the result would also be booolean.
    4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
        -> No.

Test -> should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
    1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
        -> The knowledge point of the test is to learn the behavior of bitwise operations and and determine use it.
        The official document of this knowledge point is https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html. 
    2. Why the test failed at first?
        -> The test failed at first because the expected result was assigned as 0. 
        Thus, the expected result and the actual result are not the same.
    3. Why you corrected the test that way?
        ->I corrected the test this way because I saw the bitwise operator "&" and assumed that they were needed to be joined using AND.
    4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
        -> No.

    3. Why you corrected the test that way?
        ->I corrected the test this way because I saw the bitwise operator "|" and assumed that they were needed to be joined using OR.

        -> No.

Test -> should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
    1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
        -> The knowledge point of the test is how to negate hex. The offical document of the knowledge point is

    2. Why the test failed at first?
        -> The test failed at first because the expected result was assigned as 0. 
        Thus, the expected result and the actual result are not the same.
    3. Why you corrected the test that way?
        ->I corrected the test this way because I saw the bitwise operator "~".
    4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
        -> No.
